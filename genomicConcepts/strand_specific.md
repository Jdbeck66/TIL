# Strand Specific Sequencing Protocals

[Return Home](../README.md)

## Definition

Sequences of both sense strand and the antisense strand of the original mRNA are obtained, without knowing which strand of the cDNA corresponds to the original mRNA. Consequently, it is not clear if a read originated from the sense strand or the antisense strand of the reverse transcripted mRNA.
